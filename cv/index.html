                    <dd>I joined Canonical to fulfill my long-time dream to work
                    for a Free Software company. I'm currently starting as a

                    Canonical I do my work for Linaro, a not-for-profit
                    organization that is determined to take open source
                    development on ARM to the next level by simplifying and
                    improving the whole software stack.

                    <dt><a href="http://rd.samsung.pl">Samsung R&amp;D Center in Warsaw</a> (November 2008 - April 2010)</dt>
                    <dd>I joined Samsung to see how it's like to work for a
                    major international corporation. I was assigned to the
                    Samsung Headset Platform, a division managing proprietary,
                    embedded software platform powering most Samsung mobile
                    handsets. During 2009 I lead a small team of four engineers
                    working on software customisation required to adapt generic
                    handset stack to local Polish market. Since October 2009
                    till end of April 2010 I was a Project Leader overseeing
                    commercialization of the SGH-B5310 in over a dozen
                    countries across Europe, including UK, France, Italy,
                    Poland, Spain, Greece, Sweden, Serbia, and others. I was
                    working with numerous engineers and product managers in
                    Europe and South Korea, trying to deliver the product on
                    time. During those challenging times I learned a lot about
                    inner workings of this huge corporation. On several
                    occasions I re-located to Samsung plant 2 in Gumi,
                    Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea where I worked with many Korean
                    colleagues, learning not only from their technical
                    experience but from their culture and working style as
                    well. Overall I learned a about technical aspects of
                    modern mobile phone stack including RtOS design, mobile
                    phone system architecture, SoC graphics capabilities,
                    GSM/UMTS technology, bringing products to market, adapting
                    software to local requirements and working with large
                    teams. In the end I decided to return to my roots and leave
                    Samsung for Canonical, the maker of Ubuntu.</dd>

                    <dd>I joined Sentivision in February 2006 and quickly
                    started influencing company's technical decisions. About
                    half a year later I became a Software Designer (later
                    called Software Architect) responsible for researching new
                    technologies, creating project analysis and technical
                    design documents with detailed implementation schematics.
                    During my time at Sentivision I spent three months on a
                    business stay in Tokyo, Japan and aided in an on-going
                    development for several customers. I worked on a dozen of
                    medium and large projects for various international
                    corporations. Projects, while quite differentiated were all
                    revolving around creating and delivering firmware for
                    various STB's with DaVinci, SMP 86xx and BCM 74xx
                    processors. I learned a great deal about embedded
                    development, software design, IPTV market and surrounding
                    technology. Sadly I was forced to leave Sentivision in
                    August 2008 when the company was shut down by our
                    investors.</dd>

                    <dd>I was the lead developer of a research project that

                    The project (which is now open source) created a novel
                    database storage engine for vasts amounts of text and a
                    powerful query processor capable of running very complex
                    queries over tens of gigabytes of data. The project was
                    finished with the aid of my friend <a
                        href="http://korpus.pl/~nathell/">Daniel Janus</a>.
                    Daniel also added rich GUI client, modern website and
                    networked search server (written in C and Java).</dd>

                    <dd>I was working as a subcontractor to create two

                    thing of interest was a clean and intuitive design,
                    cross-platform compatibility and a small database engine
                    created in JavaScript. The project also creates some support

                    interesting aspect of that project is that almost all of the
                    content was provided in both English and Polish. I had to make
                    some adjustments to the content management system to make that
